base.py file is already working. I am making a small modification to write to database when ever the new trade is taken instead of writing after 30sec. 
In this case I will know immediately if my entry price is correct.

Adding refresh token concept so that the token refresh everyday


Need to add the control flag check from db to take trade and condition of vix and atr filter.
also live trades code is not there now. Stocko tokens are not used in env variable and in code. Need to add it.
Also add env variable of paper/live trade.
